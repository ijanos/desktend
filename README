                      automatic virtual desktop extender

About
-----

Update the number of virtual desktops of EWMH compatible X11 window managers.
Add a new virtual desktop to the right every time there is a new window appears
on the last desktop.

I only tested this with openbox. Any feedback is welcome.

Install
-------

Compile it with X11 libraries and c99 with gnu extension support.

    gcc desktend.c -lX11 -std=gnu99 -o desktend

Copy the binary wherever you like. 

Usage
-----

Just run it. Close it with ctrl-c or kill it.

Eg: Add it to your openbox autostart.sh file: 

    echo "/path/to/desktend &" >> ~.config/openbox/autostart.sh
